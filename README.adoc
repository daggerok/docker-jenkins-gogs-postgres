// = quick GitLab + Jenkins test infrastructure in Docker
= quick GoGs + Jenkins test infrastructure in Docker

1) start all

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

2) copy jenkins initial administration password from terminal,
   go to http://127.0.0.1:18080/ paste it here and install recommended plugins...

3) while jenkins doing setupping go to http://127.0.0.1:13000/

4) install with postgres database:
   host = p.daggerok.com,
   port = 5432,
   db = gogs,
   user = gogs,
   password = gogs

5) setup correct public url, like http://g.daggerok.cm:13000/

4) create gogs admin user

5) back to jenkins and after it finish intalling plugins, create jenkins admin user

6) when you done with development, just stop docker-compos, so later you can continue with same command from first point
